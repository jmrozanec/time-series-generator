            Return a Visibility Graph encoding the particular time series.

            A visibility graph converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph
            uses integer nodes to indicate which event in the series the node represents.
            Edges are formed as follows: consider a bar plot of the series and view that
            as a side view of a landscape with a node at the top of each bar. An edge
            means that the nodes can be connected somehow by a "line-of-sight" without

    Return a Natural Visibility Graph of a time series.

    A visibility graph converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph
    uses integer nodes to indicate which event in the series the node represents.
    Edges are formed as follows: consider a bar plot of the series and view that
    as a side view of a landscape with a node at the top of each bar. An edge
    means that the nodes can be connected by a straight "line-of-sight" without
    being obscured by any bars between the nodes. The limit parameter introduces
    a limit of visibility and the nodes are connected only if, in addition to
    the natural visibility constraints, limit<x2-x1. Such a limit aims to reduce
    the effect of noise intrinsic to the data.

    The resulting graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure.
    Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, random series convert
    into random graphs, and fractal series convert into scale-free networks [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    limit : integer
       A limit established to the visibility between two bars of a time series.

    Returns
    -------
    Boolean
        Whether visibility is obstructed between the two bars of a time series.

    Return a Parametric Visibility Graph of a time series.

    A visibility graph converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph
    uses integer nodes to indicate which event in the series the node represents.
    Regardless the strategy used to define how edges are constructed, this class
    introduces additional constraints, ensuring that the angle between two
    observations meets a threshold parameter (visiblity_angle) [1]. Furthermore,
    additional constraints can be placed, ensuring that the absolute values of the
    angle between two observations and the threshold are considered [2].

    Parameters
    ----------
    visibility_angle : float
        A limit established to the visibility angle between two observations of a time series.
    consider_visibility_angle_absolute_value: bool, optional
        If True, the absolute values of the angle and the threshold are considered.

    Returns
    -------
    Boolean
        Whether visibility is obstructed between the two observations of a time series.
